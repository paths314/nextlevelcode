        <h1>Roasting Tech CEOs Is Fun. But Senators, Please Do Your Job.</h1>
        <h3>Mark Zuckerberg was humiliated into making a public apology, but that won’t do anything to eliminate harmful content on social media.</h3><br>
        <p>The five CEOs of Meta, X, Snap, Discord and TikTok spent their mornings getting ripped to shreds by senators. The subject of the hearing was the spread of child sexual exploitation online and the tech companies’ failure to protect kids from predators. Although each of the tech chiefs drew the ire of the 21-member Senate Judiciary Committee, Mark Zuckerberg stood at the center of the firing line.<br><br>

            Senator Lindsey Graham told the Meta CEO he had “blood on his hands.” Senator Ted Cruz discussed a damning screenshot of an Instagram warning screen about sexual abuse that gave users a choice to “get resources” or “see results anyway.” Senator Josh Hawley even called on Zuckerberg to apologize directly to the families whose children were harmed by his platform’s algorithm. Zuckerberg acquiesced, turning around to address the crowd as they held up pictures of the victims. Although the Meta CEO made a massive error in judgement and the video clips of him are going viral, Dave Lee says everyone has grown frustrated by this process. “It’s not the first time that Mark Zuckerberg has been called in front of Congress for a dressing down in front of the cameras. And it seems with all these hearings, very little progress is being made. If there’s laws that can be passed and they can be passed soon, then maybe now it’s up to Congress to do its job.” There’s just one problem with that: The public trusts businesses more than politicians to solve social problems. So what’s a CEO to do? “Activists beat the drum of corporate responsibility more loudly by the day. Yet the idea of ethical business is a conceptual and practical minefield,” Adrian Wooldridge writes. A new book by Alison Taylor, Higher Ground: How Business Can Do the Right Thing in a Turbulent World, provides some clues: “US companies are particularly prone to ethical scandals because their boards are so often beholden to CEOs rather than providing a robust system of oversight.” <br><br>

            And if the throne is up for grabs, Beth Kowitt suggests that companies play it straight when it comes to their succession plans, just like Levi Strauss & Co. did with its new CEO Michelle Gass. “Research has shown that the market value erased by bad CEO and C-suite transitions among the S&P 1500 is almost $1 trillion a year. Nearly a third of directors say companies don’t spend enough time on succession planning,” she writes. Getting this stuff wrong doesn’t just taint the legacy of the CEO, it can cost a company its reputation.</p>
